#FAQ

## How is a typical day and what kind of support the instructor offers?

	A typical day's core hours are from 10am-6pm, but students tend to continue to work into the evenings and on the weekends as well. As our curriculum improves over each iteration, schedules will vary from day to day. However, a regular day may look something like this:

		- Start the day at 10am with a lecture on core concepts roughly hour in length.
		- Work on the given challenges with a pair until lunch.
		- Break for lunch from 12-1:30pm. Most students tend to have lunch together and then get back to work.
		- Around 3pm, instructors will have a stand-up with the student and discuss roadblocks, challenges, and victories.
		- The day ends at 6pm, however, most students usually continue working until 8pm or later

	Throughout the day, instructors are frequently checking the code being pushed by the students and are always more than willing to sit down one on one with a student to review their code. Furthermore, everyone at Byte Academy is required to join our Slack channel where students have access to instructors even on nights and weekends.


## How do you monitor student's progress?
	 
	Instructors hold daily stand-ups and are constantly checking-in with students to discuss any roadblocks they may have encountered throughout the day. On the chance, that an instructor isn't available at the given moment and as students get more accustomed to git and the Github workflow, we expect students to be pushing up their code to Github so that instructors can review, monitor, and comment directly on their submissions.
